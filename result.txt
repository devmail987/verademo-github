CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'): com/veracode/verademo/controller/ToolsController.java:56
Details: <span>This call to java.lang.Runtime.exec() contains a command injection flaw.  The argument to the function is constructed using untrusted input.  If an attacker is allowed to specify all or part of the command, it may be possible to execute commands on the server with the privileges of the executing process.  The level of exposure depends on the effectiveness of input validation routines, if any. The first argument to exec() contains tainted data.

CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS): WEB-INF/views/profile.jsp:248
Details: <span>This call to jQueryResult.attr() contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.  The application populates the HTTP response with untrusted input, allowing an attacker to embed malicious content, such as Javascript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.  XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis. </span> <span>Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response.  The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc.  Both the OWASP Java Encoder library and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md.

Moreover, the password cannot be changed without patching the software.  If a hard-coded password is compromised in a commercial product, all deployed instances may be vulnerable to attack.  In some cases, this finding may indicate a reference to a password (e.g. the name of a key in a properties file) rather than an actual password.

CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting'): com/veracode/verademo/controller/UserController.java:173
Details: <span>This call to javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse.addCookie() contains an HTTP response splitting flaw.

Injecting entire response bodies can not only cause XSS attacks to succeed but may even poison the cache of any intermediary proxies between the clients and the application server.

Alternatively, some of the XSS escaping functions from the OWASP Java Encoder project will also sanitize CRLF sequences.  Only create a custom blocklist when absolutely necessary.

CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs: com/veracode/verademo/controller/UserController.java:708
Details: <span>This call to org.apache.log4j.Category.info() could result in a log forging attack.  Writing untrusted data into a log file allows an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into log files.  Corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker's tracks or as a delivery mechanism for an attack on a log viewing or processing utility.  For example, if a web administrator uses a browser-based utility to review logs, a cross-site scripting attack might be possible. The first argument to info() contains tainted data. The tainted data originated from an earlier call to AnnotationVirtualController.vc_annotation_entry.</span> <span>Avoid directly embedding user input in log files when possible.  Sanitize untrusted data used to construct log entries by using a safe logging mechanism such as the OWASP ESAPI Logger, which will automatically remove unexpected carriage returns and line feeds and can be configured to use HTML entity encoding for non-alphanumeric data.  Alternatively, some of the XSS escaping functions from the OWASP Java Encoder project will also sanitize CRLF sequences.  Only create a custom blocklist when absolutely necessary.

Details: <span>This call to javax.servlet.ServletResponse.setContentType() contains an HTTP response splitting flaw.  Writing untrusted input into an HTTP header allows an attacker to manipulate the HTTP response rendered by the browser, to inject additional headers or an entire response body into the response stream.

CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS): com/veracode/verademo/controller/BlabController.java:204
Details: <span>This call to getMoreFeed() contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.  The application populates the HTTP response with untrusted input, allowing an attacker to embed malicious content, such as Javascript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.  XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis. The tainted data originated from an earlier call to java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeQuery.</span> <span>Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response.  The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc.  Both the OWASP Java Encoder library and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md. In addition, as a best practice, always validate untrusted input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.</span> <span>References: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html">CWE</a> <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">OWASP</a> <a href="https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_cleansers">Supported Cleansers</a></span>

CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs: com/veracode/verademo/commands/IgnoreCommand.java:46
Details: <span>This call to org.apache.log4j.Category.info() could result in a log forging attack.  Writing untrusted data into a log file allows an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into log files.  Corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker's tracks or as a delivery mechanism for an attack on a log viewing or processing utility.  For example, if a web administrator uses a browser-based utility to review logs, a cross-site scripting attack might be possible. The first argument to info() contains tainted data from the variable sqlQuery. The tainted data originated from earlier calls to AnnotationVirtualController.vc_annotation_entry, and java.sql.Statement.executeQuery.</span> <span>Avoid directly embedding user input in log files when possible.  Sanitize untrusted data used to construct log entries by using a safe logging mechanism such as the OWASP ESAPI Logger, which will automatically remove unexpected carriage returns and line feeds and can be configured to use HTML entity encoding for non-alphanumeric data.  Alternatively, some of the XSS escaping functions from the OWASP Java Encoder project will also sanitize CRLF sequences.  Only create a custom blocklist when absolutely necessary.  Always validate untrusted input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.</span> <span>References: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html">CWE</a> <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection">OWASP</a> <a href="https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_cleansers?tocId=nYnZqAenFFZmB75MQrZwuA">Supported Cleansers</a></span>

XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis.
